### Project Overview 

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales perfomance of an e-commerce company over the past year. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations, and again a deeper understanding of the company's performance. 

### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "sales_data.csv" file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company. 

### Tools 

- Excel - Data Cleaning

- SQL Server - Data Analysis
- Power BI - Creating reports 

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products are top sellers?
- What are the peak sales periods?

### Data Analysis

Include some interesting code/features worked with 

'''sql
SELECT*FROM table1 
WHERE cond = 2; 
'''

### Results/ Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The company's sales have been steadily increasing over the past year, with a noticeable peak during the holiday season. 
2. Product Category A is the best-performing category in terms of sales and revenue.
3. Customer segments with high lifetime value (LTV) should be targeted for marketing efforts.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the followng actions: 
- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue. 
- Focus on expanding and promoting products in Category A
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target hight LTV customers effectively. 

### Limitations 

I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue colums because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions form anaysis. There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
